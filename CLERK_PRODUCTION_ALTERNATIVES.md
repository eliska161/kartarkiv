# Clerk Production Setup - Domain Alternatives

## Problem
Netlify.app domains cannot be used for Clerk production instances. We need an alternative approach.

## Alternative 1: Custom Domain (Recommended)
If you have access to a custom domain (e.g., kartarkiv.no, eok.no):

### Steps:
1. **Purchase/Use Custom Domain**
   - Buy a domain or use an existing one
   - Configure DNS to point to Netlify

2. **Configure Netlify Custom Domain**
   - In Netlify Dashboard, go to "Domain settings"
   - Add your custom domain
   - Configure DNS records as instructed

3. **Use Custom Domain in Clerk**
   - Use your custom domain in Clerk production setup
   - Example: `https://kartarkiv.no` or `https://kartarkiv.eok.no`

## Alternative 2: Railway Subdomain (Temporary Solution)
Use Railway's subdomain for the entire application:

### Steps:
1. **Deploy Frontend to Railway**
   - Move the React app to Railway
   - Use Railway's subdomain (e.g., `kartarkiv-production.up.railway.app`)

2. **Update Clerk Configuration**
   - Use Railway subdomain in Clerk production setup
   - Example: `https://kartarkiv-production.up.railway.app`

## Alternative 3: Development Mode for Now
Continue using development mode while planning for production:

### Steps:
1. **Keep Current Setup**
   - Continue using Clerk development keys
   - Accept the warning for now
   - Focus on getting the application working first

2. **Plan for Future**
   - Purchase a custom domain
   - Set up proper production deployment later

## Alternative 4: Use Vercel (If Preferred)
Deploy to Vercel which allows custom domains more easily:

### Steps:
1. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Deploy the React app
   - Use Vercel's domain or add custom domain

2. **Configure Clerk**
   - Use Vercel domain in Clerk production setup

## Recommendation
For immediate testing and development:
- **Use Alternative 3** (keep development mode)
- Focus on fixing the database schema first
- Plan for custom domain later

For production deployment:
- **Use Alternative 1** (custom domain) if you have access to one
- **Use Alternative 2** (Railway subdomain) as a temporary solution

## Next Steps
1. First, fix the database schema (run `create_complete_database_schema.sql`)
2. Test the application with development keys
3. Decide on domain strategy
4. Set up production deployment accordingly
